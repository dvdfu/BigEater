"Big Eater" by https://github.com/dvdfu/

As of May 4, 2014:

Moving character, can consume food objects smaller in size than itself. Grows proportionally to area. New food spawns endlessly: all objects are shrunk seemlessly once a certain threshold is reached to simulate the feeling of endless growth.
